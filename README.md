## What you used to select the scenarios, what was your approach?
The approach taken in selecting the functionality to cover with the automated tests was based on an MVP of the book
store. 
As the search feature is the core feature for the book store, this was automated first. A login scenario was also 
selected as this feature is the first touch-point of the application for users.  


## Why are they the most important
Please see above.


## What could be the next steps to your project
Further steps are initially to complete the testing for all business scenarios. Non-functional feature testing can be 
added to the solution with the use of ZED Attack Proxy to perform security scans on open APIs.
